# A game about space 
(this time I will not abandon it, as I do not have to deal with UI - Max)
Note To Saahil: Please look at "to add" list before planning your UI, as later changes may be costly timewise

Features:
* "launch" button

# **TODO immediately:**
* add a GUI protocol in a new file

To add:
* Multi-stage Rocket launches
* Orbital assembly of vehicles
* Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilisation
* Realistic tech tree (Sub-orbital, Orbital, Refurbishable, Reusable, and a lot in between and in parallel to this core progression)
* **an actual UI**
